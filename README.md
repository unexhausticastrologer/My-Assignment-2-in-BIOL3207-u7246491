# This project is my assignment 2 of BIOL3207.

The following packages are necessary for this R project: "plyr", "tidyverse", "ggplot2", "flextable", "metafor", "orchaRd".

The package "orchaRd" is basing on Daniel's study. Use "devtools::install_github("daniel1noble/orchaRd", force = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)" to install it.

The version of R need to be 4.2 or more late version.

In this project, the information in "OA_activitydat_20190302_BIOL3207.csv" was processed and merged with "clark_paper_data.csv". Then, the result was added to the "ocean_meta_data.csv" to conduct a meta analysis. The result did not show any bias in these papers.
